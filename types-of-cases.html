        <h2>Types of Medical Malpractice Cases</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">Medical malpractice can take many forms, from diagnostic errors to surgical mistakes to medication errors. Understanding common types of malpractice cases can help you recognize if you have been a victim of medical negligence.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>1. Misdiagnosis and Delayed Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>Diagnostic errors are among the most common types of medical malpractice. These occur when a healthcare provider:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Fails to diagnose a condition that should have been detected</li>
                <li>Misdiagnoses a condition as something else</li>
                <li>Delays diagnosis, allowing the condition to worsen</li>
                <li>Fails to order appropriate diagnostic tests</li>
                <li>Misinterprets test results</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Commonly Misdiagnosed Conditions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cancer (various types)</li>
                    <li>Heart attacks and cardiovascular disease</li>
                    <li>Stroke</li>
                    <li>Infections (including sepsis)</li>
                    <li>Pulmonary embolism</li>
                    <li>Aortic dissection</li>
                    <li>Meningitis</li>
                    <li>Appendicitis</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>A misdiagnosis can lead to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Delayed or improper treatment</li>
                <li>Disease progression that could have been prevented</li>
                <li>Unnecessary procedures or treatments</li>
                <li>Permanent injury or death</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>2. Surgical Errors</h3>
            <p>Surgical malpractice encompasses mistakes made before, during, or after surgery. These errors can have devastating consequences.</p>

            <h4>Common Surgical Errors Include:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wrong-site surgery:</strong> Operating on the wrong body part, side, or patient</li>
                <li><strong>Foreign objects left inside:</strong> Surgical instruments, sponges, or other items left in the body</li>
                <li><strong>Unnecessary surgery:</strong> Performing procedures that aren't medically necessary</li>
                <li><strong>Nerve damage:</strong> Inadvertent injury to nerves during surgery</li>
                <li><strong>Organ puncture or damage:</strong> Unintended damage to organs during procedures</li>
                <li><strong>Infection:</strong> Failure to maintain sterile conditions</li>
                <li><strong>Anesthesia errors:</strong> Incorrect dosing or monitoring of anesthesia</li>
                <li><strong>Post-operative care failures:</strong> Inadequate monitoring or care after surgery</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="assessment-box">
                <h4>Never Events</h4>
                <p>Some surgical errors are so egregious they're called "never events"—mistakes that should never happen. These include wrong-site surgery, leaving objects in patients, and performing the wrong procedure. These cases are often easier to prove because the negligence is obvious.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>3. Medication Errors</h3>

        <section>
            <h3>5. Anesthesia Errors</h3>
            <p>Anesthesia mistakes can be particularly dangerous and even fatal. Anesthesiologists must carefully monitor patients throughout procedures.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>6. Failure to Treat</h3>

        <section>
            <h3>11. Failure to Obtain Informed Consent</h3>
            <p>Before any medical procedure, healthcare providers must obtain informed consent by explaining:</p>
