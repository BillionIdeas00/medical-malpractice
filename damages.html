        <h2>Understanding Medical Malpractice Damages</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">If you successfully prove medical malpractice, you may be entitled to compensation (called "damages") for your injuries and losses. Understanding the types of damages available and how they're calculated is crucial to evaluating your case.</p>

            <h3>Three Categories of Damages</h3>
            
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Economic Damages</h4>
                    <p>Concrete financial losses that can be calculated and documented with bills, receipts, and financial records.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Non-Economic Damages</h4>
                    <p>Subjective losses like pain, suffering, and reduced quality of life that don't have specific dollar values.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Punitive Damages</h4>
                    <p>Rare additional damages meant to punish especially egregious conduct and deter future wrongdoing.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Economic Damages</h3>
            <p>These are tangible, measurable financial losses directly caused by the malpractice:</p>

            <h4>1. Medical Expenses</h4>
            <p>All healthcare costs related to the injury:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Ongoing treatment:</strong> Physical therapy, medications, follow-up appointments</li>
                <li><strong>Future medical care:</strong> Projected lifetime medical needs</li>

            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Life Care Plans</h4>
                <p>For severe, permanent injuries, medical experts create comprehensive "life care plans" that project all future medical needs and costs over your lifetime. These plans are crucial for calculating adequate compensation.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>2. Lost Wages and Income</h4>
            <p>Compensation for income lost due to your injury:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Past lost wages:</strong> Income missed while recovering or receiving treatment</li>
                <li><strong>Lost earning capacity:</strong> Reduced ability to earn income in the future</li>
                <li><strong>Lost benefits:</strong> Health insurance, retirement contributions, bonuses</li>
                <li><strong>Career advancement:</strong> Lost promotions or opportunities</li>
                <li><strong>Job retraining:</strong> Costs of learning new skills if you can't return to your profession</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="assessment-box">
                <h4>Calculating Lost Earning Capacity</h4>
                <p>Economic experts consider:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Benefits and perks</li>
                    <li>Inflation and economic factors</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This often results in substantial awards, especially for young victims who face decades of reduced earnings.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>3. Other Economic Losses</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transportation costs:</strong> Travel to medical appointments</li>

                <li><strong>Funeral and burial costs:</strong> In wrongful death cases</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Non-Economic Damages</h3>
            <p>These compensate for intangible losses that significantly impact quality of life:</p>

            <h4>1. Pain and Suffering</h4>

                <li>Painful medical treatments or procedures</li>
                <li>Future pain you'll experience</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Emotional Distress</h4>
            <p>Psychological and emotional impact:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anxiety and depression</li>
                <li>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li>
                <li>Fear and worry about health</li>
                <li>Humiliation or embarrassment</li>
                <li>Loss of enjoyment of life</li>

            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>How Are Non-Economic Damages Calculated?</h4>
                <p>Unlike economic damages, there's no formula. Juries consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Severity and permanence of injury</li>
                    <li>Degree of pain and suffering</li>
                    <li>Impact on daily life and activities</li>

                    <li>Testimony from you, family, and mental health professionals</li>
                    <li>Awards in similar cases</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>⚠️ Damage Caps:</strong> Many states limit non-economic damages in medical malpractice cases, typically ranging from $250,000 to $1 million. Some states have no caps. These limits significantly affect potential recovery and vary by state.

            <h3>Punitive Damages</h3>
            <p>Punitive (or "exemplary") damages are rare in medical malpractice cases and serve to punish and deter especially outrageous conduct.</p>

            <h4>When Punitive Damages May Apply:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intentional misconduct:</strong> Provider knew conduct was wrong</li>
                <li><strong>Gross negligence:</strong> Extreme departure from standard of care</li>
                <li><strong>Reckless disregard:</strong> Conscious indifference to patient safety</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud or concealment:</strong> Deliberately hiding mistakes</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="assessment-box">
                <h4>Examples Where Punitive Damages Might Apply:</h4>

                    <li>Knowing use of contaminated or defective equipment</li>
                    <li>Performing unnecessary procedures solely for profit</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Important Limitations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most states require clear and convincing evidence (higher standard)</li>
                <li>Many states prohibit or severely limit punitive damages in malpractice cases</li>
                <li>Some states cap punitive damages at 2-3 times compensatory damages</li>
                <li>Simple negligence doesn't qualify—conduct must be egregious</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h3>Wrongful Death Damages</h3>
            <p>When medical malpractice causes death, surviving family members can recover specific damages:</p>

            <h4>Economic Damages in Wrongful Death:</h4>
            <ul>

            <h3>State-Specific Damage Caps</h3>
            <p>Many states limit damages in medical malpractice cases. Here are general categories (always verify current law):</p>

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Damage Cap Type</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                        <th>Example States</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>No Caps</td>
                        <td>No limits on any damages</td>
                        <td>Arizona, Kentucky, Washington</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Non-Economic Only</td>
                        <td>Caps on pain/suffering; no limit on economic</td>
                        <td>California ($250k), Texas, Florida, Ohio</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Total Damages</td>
                        <td>Cap on all damages combined</td>
                        <td>Indiana, Nebraska, New Mexico</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Sliding Scale</td>
                        <td>Caps vary by injury severity</td>

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>⚠️ Caps Significantly Impact Cases:</strong> A $250,000 cap means that no matter how severe your pain, suffering, or disability, you cannot recover more than that amount for non-economic damages—even if economic damages are much higher.

        <section>
            <h3>Factors That Affect Damage Awards</h3>

                <li><strong>Impact on life:</strong> Greater life disruption means higher compensation</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Credibility:</strong> How you present yourself affects jury's sympathy</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-existing conditions:</strong> May reduce damages if they contributed to harm</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Case-Related Factors:</h4>
            <ul>

            <h3>Settlement vs. Verdict: What You Actually Receive</h3>

            </div>

            <h4>Structured Settlements</h4>
            <p>For large awards, defendants may offer structured settlements:</p>

                <li><strong>Periodic payments:</strong> Regular payments over time</li>
