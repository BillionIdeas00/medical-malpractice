        <h2>What to Expect: The Medical Malpractice Legal Process</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">Medical malpractice lawsuits are lengthy, complex, and require significant investment of time and resources. Understanding what to expect at each stage can help you prepare mentally and emotionally for the journey ahead.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h4>Timeline Overview</h4>
            <p>Medical malpractice cases typically take 2-4 years from filing to resolution, though some can take longer. Complex cases or those that go to trial may extend even further.</p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h3>Phase 1: Initial Consultation and Investigation</h3>
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 1-3 months before filing</p>

            <ol class="steps">
                <li>
                    <strong>Free Consultation</strong>
                    <p>You meet with attorney to discuss your case. Bring all medical records, documentation, and a written timeline of events.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Case Evaluation</strong>
                    <p>Attorney reviews your records and may consult with medical experts to determine if you have a viable case.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Medical Records Collection</strong>
                    <p>Your attorney obtains complete medical records from all providers involved in your care.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Expert Review</strong>
                    <p>Medical experts review records to assess whether the standard of care was breached and if it caused your injuries.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Engagement Letter</strong>
                    <p>If your case is accepted, you'll sign a representation agreement outlining fees and responsibilities.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>Note:</strong> Many legitimate cases are declined during this phase due to statute of limitations issues, insufficient damages, or inability to prove causation. This doesn't necessarily mean you weren't harmed—just that the case may not be legally viable or economically feasible.

            <h3>Phase 2: Pre-Litigation Requirements</h3>
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2-6 months</p>

            <p>Many states have specific requirements that must be completed before filing a lawsuit:</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Phase 3: Filing the Lawsuit</h3>
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Day 1 of formal litigation</p>

            <h4>The Complaint</h4>
            <p>Your attorney files a legal document called a "complaint" or "petition" that includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identification of all parties (plaintiffs and defendants)</li>
                <li>Facts of what happened</li>

            </ul>

            <h4>Service of Process</h4>
            <p>The complaint and summons must be officially delivered to all defendants. They then have a specific time (typically 20-30 days) to respond.</p>

            <h4>The Answer</h4>

                <li>Raises affirmative defenses</li>

            </ul>

        <section>
            <h3>Phase 4: Discovery</h3>
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 12-18 months (longest phase)</p>

            <p>Discovery is the process where both sides exchange information and gather evidence. This is the most time-consuming phase of litigation.</p>

            <h4>Types of Discovery:</h4>

            <div class="grid">
                <div class="card">

                    <h4>Independent Medical Exam</h4>
                    <p>Defendants may require you to be examined by their medical expert to assess:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Current medical condition</li>

            </div>

            <h4>Your Deposition</h4>
            <p>Your deposition is one of the most critical moments in your case. Your attorney will thoroughly prepare you, and you should:</p>
            <ul class="checklist">
                <li>Tell the truth—always</li>
                <li>Answer only the question asked</li>
                <li>Don't volunteer extra information</li>
                <li>Say "I don't know" if you don't know</li>
                <li>Don't guess or speculate</li>
                <li>Take your time before answering</li>
                <li>Listen carefully to each question</li>
                <li>Remain calm and professional</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>⚠️ Critical:</strong> Anything you say in deposition can be used against you at trial. Defense attorneys are skilled at getting plaintiffs to make damaging statements. Your preparation and careful answers are crucial.

        <section>
            <h3>Phase 5: Expert Reports and Disclosures</h3>
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 3-6 months during discovery</p>

            <p>Both sides must formally disclose their expert witnesses and provide detailed reports including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Expert's qualifications and CV</li>

            <h3>Phase 6: Motions Practice</h3>
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Ongoing throughout case</p>

            <p>Both sides may file various motions with the court:</p>

            <h4>Common Motions:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motion to Dismiss:</strong> Defendant argues case should be thrown out (often filed early)</li>
                <li><strong>Motion for Summary Judgment:</strong> Argues no disputed facts exist and case should be decided as a matter of law</li>
                <li><strong>Motions to Compel:</strong> Force other side to provide discovery</li>
                <li><strong>Motions in Limine:</strong> Exclude certain evidence from trial</li>
                <li><strong>Daubert Motions:</strong> Challenge admissibility of expert testimony</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Summary Judgment</h4>
                <p>This motion can end your case before trial. Defendants argue that even viewing all evidence in your favor, you cannot prove your case as a matter of law. Successfully defeating summary judgment is a significant milestone.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Phase 7: Settlement Negotiations</h3>
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Ongoing, intensifying before trial</p>

            <p>Most medical malpractice cases settle before trial. Settlement discussions may occur:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Informally between attorneys throughout the case</li>
                <li>At formal mediation sessions</li>
                <li>During settlement conferences with the judge</li>
                <li>On the courthouse steps before trial begins</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Mediation</h4>
            <p>A neutral mediator helps both sides reach a settlement. The process typically involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Opening statements by each side</li>
                <li>Separate caucuses with mediator shuttling between rooms</li>
                <li>Discussion of strengths and weaknesses</li>
                <li>Exchange of settlement offers and counteroffers</li>
                <li>Negotiation of terms</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Should You Settle?</h4>
            <p>Your attorney will help you weigh:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Certainty vs. uncertainty:</strong> Settlement guarantees recovery; trial is uncertain</li>
                <li><strong>Amount offered:</strong> Is it fair compensation for your injuries?</li>
                <li><strong>Risks of trial:</strong> Could you lose everything or win more?</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional toll:</strong> Trials are stressful and time-consuming</li>
                <li><strong>Time value:</strong> Money now vs. potentially more later</li>
                <li><strong>Appeal risks:</strong> Even a trial win can be appealed</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>Important:</strong> The decision to settle is ultimately yours, not your attorney's. Your lawyer can advise, but you make the final call.

            <h3>Phase 9: Trial</h3>

            <h4>Jury Selection</h4>

            <h4>Opening Statements</h4>
